SILPA
==========
SILPA - Indian Language computing platform which provides a web interface
for different Indian language computing python modules. This is hosted at
http://silpa.org.in

This is a new SILPA platform a.k.a restructuring is in progress. I'm trying to
use Flask microframe work and Jinja2 templating system. Additionally modules
are moved out of the original SILPA code thus providing a way for developer to
develop a python module without bothering about internals of SILPA itself.

How To Run?
==========

Note that this is currently a work in progress. So things may not work as you
expected it to work. If you want to test this you need to have following installed
on your system

* pip
* Virtualenv

Test deployment:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Silpa-Flask.git
    $ cd Silpa-Flask
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python silpa.py

If you want to Install all modules:

    $ pip install -r modules.txt

Or you can Install modules manually

* [Soudex ](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Soundex)
* [ApproxSearch](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/ApproxSearch)
* [Transliteration](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Transliteration)
* [Spellchecker](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/spellchecker)
* [Hyphenation](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Hyphenation)
* [Chardetails](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/chardetails)
* [Payyans](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/payyans)

Currently only these modules are used but you can include more you can find some more modules
in my Github account, install them and add a line in *silpa.conf* for enabling them.

Additionally we would need a *normalizer* module for *Transliteration* modules correct working.
Get it from below URL and install it in your virtual environment but ***Do not add a line to silpa.conf
for this module. Its not a web module pure python module*** 

VirtialEnv Instructions
=======================

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, chances are that one of the following two commands will work for you:
```shell
$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
```

or even better:
```shell
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```

One of these will probably install virtualenv on your system. Maybe it’s even in your package manager. If you use Ubuntu, try:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell and create your own environment. 
```shell
$ git clone git://github.com/copyninja/Silpa-Flask.git
$ cd Silpa-Flask
$ virtualenv silpa
New python executable in silpa/bin/python
Installing distribute............done.
```

Now, whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate the corresponding environment. On OS X and Linux, do the following:

```shell
$ . silpa/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows user, the following command is for you:
```shell
$ silpa\scripts\activate.bat
```
Either way, you should now be using your virtualenv (notice how the prompt of your shell has changed to show the active environment).

Now you can just enter the following command to get Flask activated in your virtualenv:

```shell
$ pip install Flask
```

A few seconds later and you are good to go.

You can start the silpa application by 
```shell
python silpa.py
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Well not exactly. You will see error messages saying Failed to import module xyz. That means you need to install the modules.
Here is an example module installation for Soundex. Repeat this for other modules.

```shell
mkdir modules
cd modules
git clone git://github.com/copyninja/Soundex.git
cd Soundex
python setup.py install
```

And restart the server by just killing and running python silpa.py again.

Wanna Help?
==========

Your help is most welcome. You can do following to help me

1. Help me separate out modules from original Silpa
2. Use it and report me bugs
3. Help me update docs
4. Get a new design for SILPA


TODO
==========

1. Implement JSONRPC so these modules can actually function [Done]
2. Serve Documentation and other pages through Flask and implement Jinja2 
3. Get remaining modules of SILPA get their templates
4. Provide RESTful API for all modules

Known Bugs
===========

1. Transliteration module is not in working state [FIXED]
2. Hyphenate module breaks it needs guesslanguage module
