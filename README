SILPA - Indian Language computing platform which provides a web interface
for different Indian language computing python modules. This is hosted at

http://silpa.org.in

This is a new SILPA platform a.k.a restructuring is in progress. I'm trying to
use Flask microframe work and Jinja2 templating system. Additionally modules
are moved out of the original SILPA code thus providing a way for developer to
develop a python module without bothering about internals of SILPA itself.

System Dependencies
===================

`Pango` and `cairo` can not be installed with pip and need to be installed
from your platform’s packages. `lxml` and `CFFI` can, but you’d still need
their own dependencies. This section lists system packages for lxml or
CFFI when available, the dependencies otherwise. lxml needs `libxml2`
and `libxslt`, CFFI needs `libffi`. On Debian, the package names with
development files are `libxml2-dev`, `libxslt1-dev` and `libffi-dev`.


###Debian 7.0 Wheezy or newer, Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric or newer:
```shell
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-lxml libcairo2 \
     libpango1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info
	 ```

####Debian 6.0 Squeeze, Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid:

GDK-PixBuf is part of GTK+, which also depends on cairo and Pango.

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-lxml libgtk2.0-0 libffi-dev
```
###Fedora
```shell
sudo yum install python-devel python-pip python-lxml cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2\
   libffi-devel
```
###Archlinux
```shell
sudo pacman -S python-pip python-lxml cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2
```

###Mac OS X

####With Macports
```shell
sudo port install py27-pip py27-lxml cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2 libffi
```
####With Homebrew:
```shell
brew install python cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libxml2 libxslt libffi
```


VirtualEnv Instructions
=======================

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, chances are that one of the following
two commands will work for you:

```shell
$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
```

or even better:
```shell
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```

One of these will probably install virtualenv on your system. Maybe it
can be even in your package manager. If you use Ubuntu, try:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell and create
your own environment.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:Project-SILPA/Silpa-Flask.git
$ cd Silpa-Flask
$ virtualenv --system-site-packages silpa
New python executable in silpa/bin/python
Installing distribute............done.
```

Now, whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate
the corresponding environment. On OS X and Linux, do the following:

```shell
$ . silpa/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows user, the following command is for you:

```shell
$ silpa\scripts\activate.bat
```
Either way, you should now be using your virtualenv (notice how the
prompt of your shell has changed to show the active environment).

Now you can just enter the following command to get Flask installed in
your virtualenv:

```shell
$ pip install Flask
```

The following modules are available for SILPA:

* [Soundex ](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/soundex)
* [ApproxSearch](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/inexactsearch)
* [Transliteration](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Transliteration)
* [Spellchecker](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/spellchecker)
* [Hyphenation](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Hyphenation)
* [Chardetails](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/chardetails)
* [Payyans](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/payyans)
* [Text Similarity](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/text-similarity)
* [N Gram](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/indicgram)
* [Silpa Sort](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/ucasort)
* [Indic Stemmer](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/indicstemmer)
* [Katpayadi Numbers](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Katapayadi)
* [shingling](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/shingling)
* [Indic-fortune](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/indicfortune) now renamed silpa-fortune
* [scriptrender](https://github.com/Project-SILPA/scriptrender)

Modules to be used with SILPA can be configured in the silpa.conf
file. Modules marked 'yes' should be installed before running SILPA

Here is a module installation example for Soundex. Repeat this for
other modules.

```shell
mkdir modules
cd modules
git clone git@github.com:Project-SILPA/soundex.git
cd Soundex
python setup.py install
```

Now you can start SILPA by running
```shell
$ python silpa.py
```
You can access SILPA at http://localhost:5000

If SILPA was running during a module installation, you will need to
restart the server by killing and running `python silpa.py` again.

How to Contribute?
==========

Your help is most welcome. You can do following to help me

1. ~~Help me separate out modules from original SILPA~~
2. Use it and report bugs
3. Help me update docs
4. ~~Get a new design for SILPA~~


TODO
==========

1. ~~Serve Documentation and other pages through Flask and implement Jinja2~~
2. ~~Get remaining modules of SILPA get their templates~~
3. Provide RESTful API for all modules

Known Bugs
===========

1. ~~Hyphenate module breaks it needs guesslanguage module~~
